# Floppy_Bird
The flamous game, floppy bird, finally implemented on VHDL.

Its a very basic version of the full game, suitable for the FPGA Basys 2 Spartan 3E from Xilinx.

This was a student project for the University of Seville.
We dont have plans to debug beyond this point.  
You can find spanish 'doc' as documentacion.pdf in this same git repo.
